## How it works
**SuperApp** enhances Django by allowing developers to divide their projects into **multiple independent apps**. Each app can have its own `settings.py` and `urls.py` files, which are automatically imported by the system. This modular approach promotes better organization and scalability of Django projects.


## `superapp/apps/<app_name>/settings.py`
When an app is included in your project, the system will execute `extend_superapp_settings` to update the main settings with the configurations defined in the app.

```py filename="superapp/apps/<app_name>/settings.py"
def extend_superapp_settings(main_settings):
    # Add the app to the installed apps
    main_settings['INSTALLED_APPS'] += [
        'superapp.apps.sample_app',
    ]
```

## `superapp/apps/<app_name>/urls.py`
When an app is included in your project, the system will execute `extend_superapp_urlpatterns` extend the main URL patterns of a Django SuperApp with additional routes.

```py filename="superapp/apps/<app_name>/urls.py"
from django.urls import path

from superapp.apps.sample_app.views import hello_world


def extend_superapp_urlpatterns(main_urlpatterns):
    # Add new URL patterns.
    main_urlpatterns += [
        path('hello_world/', hello_world),
    ]

```
