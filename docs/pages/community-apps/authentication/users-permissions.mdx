# Users Permissions

Permissions allow you to restrict access to certain parts of the admin portal. This is useful when you have multiple types of users and want to restrict access to certain parts of the application

## Instructions
<Steps>
### Create Group
    Go to `Groups` and then create a group named `limited-users` and grant the following permissions:
    ```
    - Can view users
    - Can view sample model
    ```

### Create User
    Go to `Users` on admin interface and create a new user (username: `limited-user`, pass: `dev12345`) and mark it as staff.
    Make sure to assign the user to the `limited-users` group.

    Obs. Staff members can login to the admin interface.

### Add Permission to Sidebar Navigation Link
    ```py filename="superapp/apps/admin_portal/settings.py"
    from django.utils.translation import gettext_lazy as _
    from django.urls import reverse_lazy


    def extend_superapp_settings(main_settings):
        # ...
        main_settings['UNFOLD']['SIDEBAR'] = {
            # ...
            "navigation": [
                {
                    "title": _("Navigation"),
                    # ...
                    "items": [
                        {
                            # ...
                            "permission": lambda request: request.user.has_perm('app.view_<modelname>'),
                        },
                    ]
                }
            ]
        }
    ```
